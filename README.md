# arduino-uno-stepper
A basic use of the arduino uno to control a stepper motor -- uses both an 128x64 oled display and a push-button encoder

this project was to help me get acquainted with a stepper motor
it uses the timer to keep the system as real-time as possible

parts list:
(1) arduino uno
(1) bipolar stepper motor (e.g., nema 17)
(1) 128x64 display (ssd1306-based)
(1) motor driver (adafriut tb6612)
(1) rotary encoder with push button
